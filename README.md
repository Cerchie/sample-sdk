# Sample SDK Repo


## Description

This repo will be an example of how to write a simple SDK (Software Development Kit) in TS and node. @Cerchie is intending to design a free course on writing SDKs. One of the parts of the course would focus on what an SDK is and how to create on from scratch, and this repository would serve as an example. 

## Roadmap

There are a few things that prevent this from being a complete example of an SDK:

  1. The tests are incomplete.
  2. The repo has not been published to npm. 
  3. The API needs to be switched to one that does not require a password, for simplicity's sake. (Easier to follow tutorials when you don't need to sign up for an API).
  
We will make some issues to track our progress.
